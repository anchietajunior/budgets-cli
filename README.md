# Budgets Control

A simple CLI budget control written using Ruby without frameworks and saving the data inside a simple csv file (to be converted in excel format in the future).

## Options

- Add payables
- Add receivables (wip)
- See balance (wip)
- Show month report (wip)

## Example

This command **budgets** is mapped in my ~/.zshrc file.
